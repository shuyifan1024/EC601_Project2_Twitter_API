# EC601_Twitter_API

This is a basic API study assignment.

Step 1: Create a Twitter account

Step 2: create an account for Tweepy and get permission to call.

step 3: copy the license password and pass the parameters.

step 4: call the API library function.

Step 5: Select a function in the API library for parameter call.

Step 6: create a new list and save API data to the list.

Step 7: use the fundction of Pandas to show the result. 

result: This time, I tried using the search function, which finds tweets based on keywords. This is a function that is used very frequently. It's very difficult to write a search engine like this, and it takes a long time to search on Twitter. If you learn how to invoke the API, it will be very simple and efficient to implement the data search function. That's what API does.
